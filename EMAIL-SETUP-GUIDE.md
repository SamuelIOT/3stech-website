# Assessment Form - Email Configuration Guide

## ✅ **Form Functionality Implemented**

The assessment page now includes:

### 🔧 **Backend Features:**
- **Form Data Storage** - Saves all submissions to `/data/assessments.json`
- **Email Notifications** - Sends confirmation emails to clients and alerts to team
- **Data Validation** - Server-side validation for required fields
- **Error Handling** - Graceful error handling with user feedback

### 📧 **Email Configuration Required:**

To enable email functionality, update these environment variables in `.env`:

```env
# Email Configuration
SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com          # Your SMTP server
SMTP_PORT=587                     # SMTP port (587 for TLS)
SMTP_USER=your-email@gmail.com    # Your email address
SMTP_PASS=your-app-password       # App password (not regular password)
FROM_EMAIL=assessments@3stech.ca  # "From" address for client emails
TEAM_EMAIL=team@3stech.ca         # Team notification email
```

### 🔑 **Gmail Setup (Recommended for Testing):**

1. **Enable 2-Factor Authentication** on your Gmail account
2. **Generate App Password:**
   - Go to Google Account Settings
   - Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords

   - Use this password in `SMTP_PASS`

The form will still work without email configuration:

Assessment data is stored in JSON format:
```json
{
  "firstName": "John",
  "lastName": "Smith", 
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "company": "Acme Corp",
  "reportCount": "51-100",
  "timeline": "3-6-months",
  "submittedAt": "2025-10-08T...",
  "ipAddress": "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"
}
```
